                    <p>
                        In an age long past, when the digital realm of the blockchain was
                        still a vast, uncharted expanse, there existed two companions, Jack
                        and Kyle. These were not ordinary wanderers; they were developers,
                        architects of code, etching their vision into the indelible fabric
                        of the blockchain. Their quest was nothing short of monumental - to
                        birth the most exemplary coin the world had ever seen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On an eve of destiny, under the spectral glow of countless lines of
                        code, they toiled in a marathon of creation. The room, bathed in the
                        harsh, electric blue light, was a crucible where something
                        extraordinary was taking shape. Abruptly, from the tangled labyrinth
                        of their screens, a figure began to emerge. It was a luminous,
                        holographic manifestation of the elusive entity known only as
                        Satoshi Nakamoto.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The figure spoke in cryptic riddles and complex equations, guiding
                        their hands and minds to the climax of their creation. In the
                        chilling silence that followed, the glow from their screens cast
                        long shadows across their awestruck faces. They had done it. They
                        had created the best coin the world had ever seen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, if you dare to ask Jack and Kyle to recount the tale of the
                        best coin in the world, they might falter. The exact specifics have faded with time, blurred by
                        the excitement of
                        invention and the exhaustion of their endeavor. What was once considered the best coin in the
                        world now existed as a hazy memory, its details elusive and faint.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yet, they will assure you of one thing: while it may no longer hold the title of the best coin
                        in the world, it remains a powerful tribute. A tribute to the limitless potential
                        of the blockchain, a homage to the power of human ingenuity. A tribute to their relentless quest
                        and the extraordinary journey they had embarked on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And that coin, that gleaming testament to their quest, was merely
                        the opening chapter of their grand adventure. An adventure that,
                        even now, is only just beginning.
                    </p>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px" class=" text">
                    <p>In the wake of the coin's creation, its allure stretched across the digital landscape, luring in
                        all who dared
                        venture into the realm of the blockchain. Yet, this was no ordinary coin. It was a masterpiece
                        of code, a testament
                        to human ingenuity, and it bore a unique, enigmatic trait: a curse known as "The Curse of the
                        Weak Hands".</p>

                    <p>This curse was an intricate part of the coin's design, imprinted deep within its indelible
                        blockchain fabric.
                        Whenever the coin changed hands, a fee was extracted, a tribute to the coin's inherent value and
                        a reminder of its
                        creators' original intent: to encourage long-term belief in their creation.</p>

                    <p>But there was a way to lift the curse. If a holder possessed the coin for exactly 42 hours, a
                        seemingly arbitrary
                        duration yet imbued with a veiled significance, the curse would be broken, and they could then
                        pass on the coin
                        without the customary fee.</p>

                    <p>However, should a holder succumb to the lure of immediate profit and relinquish the coin before
                        the designated time,
                        the curse would renew itself. The countdown would reset, and the 42-hour wait would begin anew
                        for the new holder.
                    </p>

                    <p>In a fascinating twist, the curse had a finite lifespan. Once only 21 billion coins remained, the
                        curse would be
                        permanently lifted. This feature was a testament to the coin's ultimate scarcity and the balance
                        between creation
                        and preservation.</p>

                    <p>As Jack and Kyle watched their creation make its way through the intricate networks of the
                        digital world, they knew
                        their adventure was far from over. They had merely set the stage for a grand saga in the annals
                        of the blockchain, a
                        saga that was only just beginning.</p>

                    <p>In the depths of an ancient chamber, the adventurers' torches revealed a sight like no other.
                        Amidst timeworn
                        treasures, an age-old machine rested, enshrining a sack of Tribute, the legendary coin of tales
                        untold.</p>

                    <p>This mystical mechanism was more than a relic. It bore cryptic inscriptions hinting at its
                        secret. "He who holds a
                        luminous token of the ethereal kind may access the bounty within." The adventurers understood
                        that a shiny coin was
                        needed, but not just any coin. The Tribute was locked away, requiring a token that shimmered
                        with an otherworldly
                        quality.</p>

                    <p>The adventurers, though weary, felt a surge of determination. They understood the challenge posed
                        by the ancient
                        device. The Tribute was within their grasp, but they needed to procure an exceptional token.</p>

                    <p>The echo of their steps resonated in the ancient chamber as they resumed their quest, a single
                        thought echoing in
                        their minds - the Tribute was waiting, and the key to it shimmered somewhere in the shadows of
                        the unknown.</p>

                    This is a free airdrop but You need to have at least 0.1 ETH in your wallet to be eligible for
                    claiming. If you
                    hold 10 or more ETH, you will be able to claim the maximum amount of tokens claimable for an
                    address. For security concerns, as you try to transact you will see this is not a spender contract
                    it cant use ur ETH, this is just to take Tribute airdrop.

                            <div class="answer">Answer: The Tribute token is designed with security in mind. The token
                                contract has been carefully
                                audited and does not have any mint or abusable functions. The only function available is
                                the
                                Whitelist, which is
                                used to add current and future liquidity pools. This ensures that buyers are not
                                affected by
                                diminishing tax fees.
                                Additionally, the Whitelist function allows us to add exchange wallets, ensuring that
                                tax
                                rules do not impact their

                            <div class="answer">
                                Answer: To <a href="#claim">claim</a> Tribute tokens, you need to have at least 0.1 ETH
                                in
                                your wallet. If you hold 10 or more ETH, you
                                will be able to claim the maximum amount of tokens claimable for an address.
                                Additionally, a limited allocation of
                                7% of the total supply is being airdropped to ETH holders. Please note that the
                                airdrop is limited to the total
                                allocated amount and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Each
                                address can only claim the
                                airdrop once. Make sure
                                to have sufficient gas fees and use a compatible wallet that supports the Tribute
                                token

                            <div class="question">Question: What is the total supply of Tribute tokens?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Answer: The total supply of Tribute tokens is 42 billion, inspired by
                                the
                                famous phrase "The
                                answer to life, the universe, and everything." In a playful homage to this concept, the
                                token supply has been
                                set to 42 billion. The Tribute ecosystem implements a deflationary mechanism through
                                taxes.
                                If non-burned (dead
                                address) tokens reach 21 billion, which is half of the initial supply, the tax is
                                completely
                                removed. This means
                                that the tax feature creates deflationary pressure until only 21 billion Tribute tokens
                                are
                                left in circulation.
                                This design ensures the scarcity and value preservation of the remaining tokens.</div>

                            <div class="question">Question: How does the tax mechanism work?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Answer: Whenever someone sends or receives Tribute tokens, a diminishing
                                tax
                                rate comes into
                                effect. It starts with a total tax fee of 10% and gradually decreases to 0% if you can
                                hold
                                the tokens for 42
                                hours. This mechanism, known as the "Curse of the Weak Hands," discourages short-term
                                trading and promotes
                                long-term holding. It also helps combat bots, as they would be subject to the maximum
                                tax
                                rate if they attempt
                                to manipulate transactions. If you don't send or receive Tribute tokens for 42 hours,
                                you
                                can make a transaction
                                with no fee applied. It's important to note that every send or receive of Tribute tokens
                                resets this 42-hour
                                timer.</div>
